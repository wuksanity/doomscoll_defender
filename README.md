# doomscroll_defender
An app to track and notify users of their social media usage in hopes of promoting better habits.

Have you noticed you or your friends spending an excessive amount of time endlessly scrolling through social media (doom scrolling), often times completely unaware of the time that passes, which leads to that terrible feeling of having wasted time? This app aims to target this group and make them aware of their habits by providing analytics and call-to-action notifications to do just that. 

This is a solo project taken on by Walker Riley to learn Kotlin and to tackle the feat of better understanding app development via some good old hands-on learning.
